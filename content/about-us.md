The **Bug Bounty Community of Interest** is comprised of a loose group of individuals with subject matter expertise and a deep interest in the Bug Bounty ecosystem. â€‹

The objective of this Community of Interest (COI) is to create a forum for interested parties (vendors, Bug Bounty managers and security researchers) to discuss common issues, share expertise, and best practices related to Bug Bounty programs, as well as identifying areas/initiatives which the COI can provide productive input to be delivered to the industry.
