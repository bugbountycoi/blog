| Create a forum for interested parties to discuss common issues, share expertise, and best practices. | Inspire the Bug Bounty community to pursue worthy initiatives designed to build trust and collaborative environments. | Encourage information sharing, awareness, active engagement, and evolution of the Bug Bounty community. |


As the Bug Bounty ecosystem and community grows and evolves, many have observed opportunities for improvement, information and expertise sharing, industry collaboration, development of best practices, and other efforts that require the collaboration between Bug Bounty managers and security practitioners.

We strive to discuss common issues, share expertise and best practices related to bug bounty programs.
