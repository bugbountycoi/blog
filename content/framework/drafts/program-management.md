## Overview

This chapter provides a structured approach to managing bug bounty programs effectively. It is based on collective experience from various program managers across the industry and serves as a foundation for both new and established programs.

## Key Concepts

### Scope Definition
- Clear documentation of in-scope assets
- Explicit out-of-scope items
- Rules of engagement
- Asset categorization

### Reward Structure
- Base reward ranges by vulnerability type
- Impact-based multipliers
- Special bonuses for critical findings
- Reward review process

### Triage Process
- Initial assessment workflow
- Severity classification
- Duplicate detection
- Communication templates

### Researcher Management
- Onboarding process
- Performance metrics
- Recognition program
- Communication channels

### Metrics and Reporting
- Key performance indicators
- Executive reporting
- Trend analysis
- ROI calculation

## Guidelines

### Implementation Steps

1. Start with a pilot program
   - Select a limited scope
   - Define clear success metrics
   - Set initial reward ranges

2. Establish clear communication channels
   - Define response SLAs
   - Set up notification workflows
   - Create templates for common responses

3. Define escalation paths
   - Critical vulnerability process
   - Management notification criteria
   - Emergency response procedures

4. Set up monitoring and metrics
   - Track key performance indicators
   - Monitor researcher engagement
   - Measure program effectiveness

5. Regular program reviews
   - Quarterly scope assessments
   - Reward structure evaluation
   - Process improvement cycles

## Best Practices

1. Maintain clear documentation
   - Keep scope current
   - Document all policy changes
   - Maintain researcher guidelines

2. Regular scope updates
   - Review monthly
   - Communicate changes clearly
   - Version control policies

3. Consistent reward decisions
   - Document precedents
   - Regular reward reviews
   - Clear escalation paths

4. Timely communications
   - Meet or exceed SLAs
   - Regular status updates
   - Proactive notifications

5. Continuous program optimization
   - Gather researcher feedback
   - Monitor industry trends
   - Implement improvements

## Examples

### Scope Definition Example
```yaml
in_scope:
  - api.example.com
  - *.prod.example.com
out_of_scope:
  - test.example.com
  - legacy.example.com
```

### Reward Matrix Example
```
Critical: $10,000 - $20,000
High:     $5,000 - $10,000
Medium:   $1,000 - $5,000
Low:      $100 - $1,000
```
