## Overview

This chapter provides a comprehensive framework for classifying and scoring vulnerabilities in bug bounty programs. It establishes consistent criteria for severity assessment and impact analysis.

## Key Concepts

### Vulnerability Categories
- Authentication Vulnerabilities
- Authorization Flaws
- Injection Vulnerabilities
- Information Disclosure
- Configuration Issues
- Business Logic Flaws

### Severity Levels
- Critical
- High
- Medium
- Low
- Informational

### Impact Dimensions
- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Availability
- Scope

## Guidelines

### Severity Assessment Process

1. Initial Triage
   - Verify vulnerability reproduction
   - Identify affected components
   - Document potential impact

2. Impact Analysis
   - Evaluate technical impact
   - Assess business impact
   - Consider attack complexity
   - Determine exploitation requirements

3. Final Classification
   - Apply scoring criteria
   - Consider context
   - Document rationale
   - Assign final severity

## Best Practices

1. Consistent Scoring
   - Use standardized criteria
   - Document exceptions
   - Regular review process

2. Clear Communication
   - Explain scoring rationale
   - Provide detailed feedback
   - Address researcher questions

3. Regular Updates
   - Review classification guidelines
   - Update for new vulnerability types
   - Maintain scoring consistency

## Examples

### Severity Scoring Matrix
```
Impact vs. Likelihood Matrix:

           Low    Medium    High
Critical   High   Critical  Critical
High       Med    High     Critical
Medium     Low    Med      High
Low        Info   Low      Med
```

### Sample Classifications
```yaml
SQL Injection:
  Base Severity: High
  Modifiers:
    - Authenticated: -1
    - PII Access: +1
    - Production: +1
  Final: Critical

XSS Reflected:
  Base Severity: Medium
  Modifiers:
    - No Authentication: +1
    - Limited Impact: -1
  Final: Medium
```
