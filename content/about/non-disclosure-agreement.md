**Effective Date:** ________________  

**Participant:** ________________  

## 1. Purpose  
BB COI facilitates open, candid, and trust-based conversations among security professionals, researchers, and stakeholders. To preserve the integrity and privacy of these discussions, all Participants agree to maintain strict confidentiality regarding the content, context, and identities involved.

## 2. Scope of Confidential Information  
"Confidential Information" includes, but is not limited to:

- Topics discussed, including technical details, strategic insights, and shared experiences  
- Identity and affiliation of any participant  
- Attributable statements made during sessions  
- Meeting formats, dates, times, and locations (physical or virtual)  
- Any written, verbal, or digital communication exchanged before, during, or after the conversation  

This applies regardless of whether the information is marked confidential or disclosed intentionally or inadvertently.

**Participant Initials:** ________

## 3. Chatham House Rules  
In alignment with and expansion of the Chatham House Rule:

> "Participants are free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be revealed."

This Agreement extends that principle to prohibit:

- Attribution of statements to any individual or organization  
- Disclosure of participant identities or affiliations  
- Sharing of contextual details that could reasonably lead to identification of participants or the nature of the conversation  
- Use of recordings, transcripts, screenshots, or summaries without written consent from BB COI and all affected Participants  

**Attribution Exception:**  
Participants may grant other Participants permission to reference their name, affiliation, or statements. However, such permission must be explicitly granted in writing (including email or chat) by the author to the intended recipient. No Participant should assume consent, and absence of such permission shall be interpreted as denial.

**Participant Initials:** ________

## 4. Participant Obligations  
Each Participant agrees to:

- Treat all Confidential Information as strictly confidential  
- Refrain from recording, transcribing, or otherwise capturing the conversation without prior written consent  
- Limit internal sharing to individuals bound by equivalent confidentiality obligations  
- Take reasonable measures to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure  

**Participant Initials:** ________

## 5. Exceptions  
This Agreement does not apply to information that:


- Was publicly known at the time of disclosure  
- Becomes publicly known through no fault of the receiving party  
- Is disclosed pursuant to legal obligation, provided prompt notice is given to BB COI and affected Participants  

## 6. Duration  
This Agreement remains in effect for a period of three (3) years from the date of the last covered conversation, unless otherwise agreed in writing.

## 7. No License  
This Agreement does not grant any license or rights to use Confidential Information for commercial, public, or derivative purposes.

## 8. Remedies  
Participants acknowledge that unauthorized disclosure may cause irreparable harm. BB COI and affected Participants may seek injunctive relief and pursue any other legal remedies available.

## 9. Governing Law  
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Bug Bounty Community of Interest (BB COI) is legally incorporated, without regard to its conflict of law principles.

## 10. Membership Pledge  
This Agreement incorporates, by reference, the BB COI Membership Pledge. By signing this NDA, Participants affirm that they have read, understood, and agreed to the terms of the pledge. Violations of the pledge may result in, at a minimum, removal from BB COI events, lists, groups, documents, and other affiliated spaces.

See **Appendix A** for full text of the pledge.

**Participant Initials:** ________

## Appendix A: BB COI Membership Pledge

As a member of this group, I agree to:

1. Use Common Sense  
This is a space for ethical security work, not chaos. Be thoughtful, professional, and respectful, even when disagreeing. (And yes, we know you have opinions about CVSS.)

2. Show Respect  
Don’t harass, stalk, name-drop, or humblebrag your way through the group. We’re here to share knowledge, not polish resumes or mine leads.

3. Maintain Anonymity  
Members may choose to participate anonymously or pseudonymously.  
**DON’T** pressure anyone to reveal personal details, affiliations, identities, or labeling themselves or their contributions.

4. Keep Private Things Private  
That includes chat logs, shared research, domain tips, unreported vulns, and the member list.  
**DON'T** leak info, sell data, or repurpose group activity for your blog post, conference talk, or presentation that came from someone else's contribution.  
**DO** feel free to have active discussions on cool things that you're working on. There's a strong chance you'll find co-writers or co-presenters here who can add value.

5. Honor the Group's Trust  
This is not anyone's personal talent pipeline, startup lead gen tool, or in-the-know contact farm. Be collaborative, not transactional.

6. Own It If You Mess Up  
We all make mistakes. If you cross a line, listen, learn, and adjust.

7. Participation Keeps This Working  
This group was created for the purpose of sharing experience and knowledge, to help others. Share your knowledge and experiences, mentor others, foster a welcoming environment, and contribute to active projects and new project ideas

By accepting our invitation you are also accepting that you have read and agree to this pledge. **Violations may result in, but are not limited to, removal from any and all BB COI events, lists, groups, documents, etc.**
