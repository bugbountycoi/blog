As the Bug Bounty ecosystem and community grows and evolves, many have observed opportunities for improvement, information and expertise sharing, industry collaboration, development of best practices, and other efforts that require the collaboration between Bug Bounty managers and security researchers.

## VISION:

The objective of this Community of Interest (COI) is to create a forum for interested parties **in operational roles** to discuss common issues, share expertise, and best practices related to Bug Bounty programs, as well as identifying areas/initiatives which the COI can provide productive input to and deliver to the industry.

## MEMBERSHIP:

People that would like to contribute to or may benefit from the vision are welcome to join this COI. This group is composed of individuals that have a deep interest or subject matter expertise in the Bug Bounty ecosystem. Individuals are represented as themselves not as envoys of specific companies. This community more closely aligns with a professional affiliation versus an industry group. New members must apply through the BB COI website. The COI Admin Board will vote on new members at least once per month and offer a request for comments to the COI community members through the General channel. The COI has 24hrs to “thumbs-up” a candidate. If a current member has concerns regarding the admittance of the candidate, they may Direct Message the sponsor (if stated) and the COI Chair for “airing of grievances.” If the sponsor and COI chair get more than one “thumbs down” on a candidate, the sponsor will lead a discussion with the COI for resolution. In case of disagreement, it is the sponsor’s responsibility to notify the candidate of the admittance status as soon as feasible. All members must agree and adhere to the [Membership Pledge](./membership-pledge.md) and sign the [Non-Disclosure Agreement](./non-disclosure-agreement.md).

## NEW MEMBER ONBOARDING:

New members will be contacted by the Admin Board for a “Meet and Greet” session. This is an informal introduction, where the new member is provided the COI Charter and basic information regarding the purpose, ethical responsibilities, membership participation expectations and any other materials. 


## ADMINISTRATIVE BOARD:

The purpose of the Administrative Board is primarily to host and moderate the COI. The AB manages tasks associated with the daily operations of the BB COI including meetings, events and other activities as required. The AB will determine long term goals and objectives and will act to achieve them. Membership is voluntary and members may join by request. The board is composed of a chair/co-chair and three members with availability for additional support functions to be determined as needed. The Chair and Co-Chair are nominated and voted on by majority vote of the AB. All AB members are self nominated and serve one year terms, reaffirmed by BB COI ranked choice vote. AB Members are affirmed/reaffirmed every year during the January Strategic community planning session. AB members may resign at any time for any reason, in the event that a position on the board is vacant any BB COI member may self nominate, the nominee is affirmed by BB COI majority vote. In the event, a request to terminate a board member occurs, the requesting member must provide rationale and evidence to the BB COI and a majority vote by the community will be triggered. See (Ethics Expectations). Board members are expected to participate in planning and attend meetings. If a board member can no longer participate, they will be asked to step back from the role. This does not preclude them for running for the board at a future time.


## SPECIAL PROJECT GROUPS:

Special project groups may be created for specific projects. At the completion of the project, the group disbands. To create a special project group, a member must nominate the project to the COI and receive approval from the COI. Special project groups are voluntary, and members may join a special project group by request.

## GOALS AND DELIVERABLES:

**Information Sharing**
-   By members – Develop benchmarking activities that can track information sharing by members over time this may include sharing lessons learned or conducting formal presentations at COI Meetings.
-   For members - Define the ecosystems for information - discussion items for the group which are targeted to the internal group for consumption.
-   For Cybersecurity Community - develop external stakeholder information to be shared with external entities. For example:
    -   Bug Bounty and Researcher Relations framework and maturity guide
    -   Bug Bounty and relationship education

**Awareness**
-   Ongoing issues – forum to discuss timely issues and trends that may impact all or the majority of the group
-   Evolution trends – items of interest that may point the direction the ecosystem is moving
-   Best practices/lessons learned

**Engagement**
-   Engagement with independent security researchers and research organizations
-   Engagement with Crowdsource Platform providers

**Evolution**
-   Provide advisory information to the community to facilitate evolution of BB programs

## FORMAT AND FREQUENCY OF MEETINGS:

Monthly virtual meetings will be held, as schedule allows, during the third week of the month for no less than one hour. In-person meetings will be held twice a year, in Late-Winter and Late-Summer, in conjunction with large conference events to encourage in-person participation. In-person meetings will likely be half day meetings. Where practical, meetings will have a virtual attendance option.
