## For members of the Bug Bounty Community of Interest

Welcome! You’ve been invited into a private space full of talented, curious, and ethically-minded people who spend their free time making things safer an d professional time operating and supporting responsible disclosure programs. We’re glad you’re here!

This group is built on trust, discretion, and shared purpose. Before participating, please read and agree to this short, no-nonsense pledge.

As a member of this group, I agree to the following:

1. Use Common Sense  
This is a space for ethical security work, not chaos. Be thoughtful, professional, and respectful, even when disagreeing. (And yes, we know you have opinions about CVSS.)

2. Show Respect 
Don’t harass, stalk, name-drop, or humblebrag your way through the group. We’re here to share knowledge, not polish resumes or mine leads.

3. Maintain Anonymity  
Members may choose to participate anonymously or pseudonymously.
**DON’T** pressure anyone to reveal personal details, affiliations, identities, or labeling themselves or their contributions.

4. Keep Private Things Private  
That includes chat logs, shared research, domain tips, unreported vulns, and the member list.  
**DON'T** leak info, sell data, or repurpose group activity for your blog post, conference talk, or presentation that came from someone else's contribution.  
**DO** feel free to have active discussions on cool things that you're working on. There's a strong chance you'll find co-writers or co-presenters here who can add value.

5. Honor the Group's Trust 
This is not anyone's personal talent pipeline, startup lead gen tool, or in-the-know contact farm. Be collaborative, not transactional.

6. Own It If You Mess Up  
We all make mistakes. If you cross a line, listen, learn, and adjust. 

7. Participation Keeps This Working  
This group was created for the purpose of sharing experience and knowledge, to help others. Share your knowledge and experiences, mentor others, foster a welcoming environment, and contribute to active projects and new project ideas

## Closing Thoughts
We’re here to make things better; Whether that’s safer apps, stronger programs, or better friendships in the security community, we want to support you. That only works if we trust each other to be good humans, act ethically, and not be, well... jerks. 

By accepting our invitation you are also accepting that you have read and agree to this pledge. **Violations may result in, but are not limited to, removal from any and all BB COI events, lists, groups, documents, etc.**  

Welcome aboard! 

Sincerely,  
*The Bug Bounty Community of Interest Administration Board*
