## Submit Your Presentation

The Bug Bounty Community of Interest (BBCOI) welcomes presentation proposals from bug bounty program managers and security professionals. Share your experiences, insights, and best practices with the community. Submissions are reviewed periodically and if eligible, you will be contacted to schedule a slot for an upcoming meeting. We accept speakers for 40-50 minute slots at our regular monthly meetings from February through November (December is not a regular meeting, January has a recurring and strict agenda with no speakers). One-off meetings may also be scheduled for custom durations and timeslots at your request.
